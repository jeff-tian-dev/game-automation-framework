# Clash of Clans Autoloot
Automate your looting in Clash of Clans!

AutoLoot is designed to optimize league bonus farming by automating rapid, low-commitment attacks.
The system focuses on deploying predefined troop patterns to quickly secure a single star, then exiting the battle immediately to maximize bonus efficiency per unit time.
To reduce repetition and improve robustness, attack patterns and deployment timing are randomized within controlled bounds, introducing natural variation between runs.

This project does not interact with game servers directly and does not modify game files.
